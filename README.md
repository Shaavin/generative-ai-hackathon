# Generative AI Hackathon

Created by Ian Penrod

## Usage Notes
- This project expects you to have a resumes/ directory, which it will search for resumes
- Make sure to include your Cohere API key at the top of the project
- You can either:
  - Run this tool for one resume by typing `python3 main.py -f single -r <name of resume in /resumes directory>` (will give 5 suggestions)
  - Run this tool for every resume by typing `python3 main.py -f all` (will give 1 suggestion per resume)
